<p align="center" class="style2">Gongs-Bells-Drums</p>
<p align="center" class="style5">Many instruments are used during a Buddhist service to help signal events and keep beat during chanting. Here are a few.</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><img src="../Pics/mokusho.png" width="424" height="288" />Moku-sho</p>
<p align="left" class="style5">A type of wooden drum <em>(moku-sho)</em> is used to keep the beat during chanting of the <a href="Sutra.html">Lotus Sutra</a> and Odaimoku <em>(sacred title)</em>. This instrument has a high pitched sound that can be heard over the chanting and drumming common in Nichiren Shu Temples. The moku-sho in the Las Vegas Temple is up beside the head ministers seat. Another wooden drum used in ceremony is called a moku-gyo. Also known as a fish  drum because of its round shape with a dragon or fish carved into it. It is used for a more subdued sound, usually at funerals and memorials were drums are not used. A moku-gyo is seen in the picture of the Altar at the Las Vegas Temple in the lower left.</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">Kana-Maru<img src="../Pics/kanamaru.png" width="288" height="195" /></p>
<span class="style5">Many bells are used during ceremony. Each bell has a different sound which helps everyone know where we are during the service. The kana-maru is a large bowl shaped bell used to signal the beginning and ending of service and also the beginning and ending of each section of the <a href="Sutra.html">Lotus Sutra</a> chanted. A smaller bowl shaped bell called the inken is used to signal different functions such as the singing of Shomyo (Buddhist Hymns). The head minister uses a flat bell called the kei (just to the right where the head minister sits) to signal each new part of the service.</span>
<p align="right" class="style2">Taiko<img src="../Pics/taiko.png" width="432" height="293" /></p>
<span class="style5">In Nichiren Shu we use drums while chanting the title of the Lotus Sutra (Odaimoku). A large taiko is used during the service to help keep the beat and each member of the Sangha may also use a hand taiko. The heavenly sound reverberates through the universe to proclaim the Dharma.</span>
