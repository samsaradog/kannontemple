  <p class="style4">&quot;Anyone who keeps, reads and recites this Lotus Sutra, memorizes it correctly, studies it. practices it, and copies it. should be considered to see Sakyamuni Buddha, and hear this sutra from the Buddha's mouth. He should be considered to be making offerings to the Buddha. He should be considered to be praised by the Buddha with the word 'Excellent!' He should be considered to be caressed by the Buddha on the head. He should be considered to be covered with the Buddha 's robe.&quot;</p>

<p class="style1"><br />
  Since the establishment of Nichiren Buddhist Kannon Temple of Nevada on New Year’s Day, 2008; over three and half years have passed. Rev. &amp; Mrs. Shokai Kanai opened their house to the public. The house is located in a residential area in Las Vegas, where we are very limited in propagation, we cannot beat drums, chanting loudly, place a banner of the name of the temple and cannot advertise. When there are over 20 people, the house is too small. Therefore we wish to buy a building in a commercial zone in early 2012.<br />
  We started the Shakyo Project to raise funds for buying a house or building for the temple. If you would like to help us, please print out in color mode the Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra from our web site on legal size paper and trace the gray part of the pages with a ball point pen or pencil. If you cannot print it well, please contact Rev. Shokai Kanai at (702)396-6276. He will send it to you by mail. After finishing the trace, please write your name, address and also your prayers or the name of loved ones in memory for them. Then send your copied booklet with your donation to the Kannon Temple of Nevada, so Rev. Kanai will pray for your wishes and loved ones during the morning service for one hundred days. Please do not write in the “No. ___” section. This is for our records to keep track for posterity.<br />
  Chapter 28 of the Lotus Sutra says, “Anyone who copies this sutra will be reborn in the Heaven immediately after his or her present life.” Rev. Kanai will send you a certificate of your offertory of the sutra tracing, so you can use it as an amulet or you can take it with you when you leave this Saha World.<br />
  You can trace the sutra as many times as you wish. If you wish to trace a Japanese version, please let Rev. Kanai know how many shakyo booklets you request. He will send them to you.<br />
  Thank you very much for your corporation!</p>
